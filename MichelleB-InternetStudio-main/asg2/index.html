<h1>Assignment 2</h1>



    <h2>Part 2/4</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The difference between structured content and semantic HTML is that structured content is more orgainzed (hence the name), so it will need the heading, paragraphs, imgs, all in the right order.
        Semantic HTML uses the actual word for the tags; For example, the heading tag is written: <.heading >. </li>

    <li>Structured Content and Semantic HTML work together by making coding more organized and readable. One focuses on structure and the other on label.</li>
    
    <li>Its really important for Structured content and Semantic HTML in my web pages because it helps with the readability, and helps keep my attention retention.</li>
