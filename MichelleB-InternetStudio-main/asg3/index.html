	<li>Framing a project in the form of a story format can help to distill ideas by articulating them with a clear purpose and emotional connection.
		That is why it helps teams to see the user journey and understand their needs, and can connect all elements of the project to a meaningful goal
		in an overall direction. It enables the concept to be broken down into manageable components that simplify complex concepts, facilitates
		co-creation and provides a final product that will resonate with its audience. A good example of this is the reading which reads,
		"Storytelling can help reframe business problems so that projects solve the right problems and come to a better solution."</li>
	<li>Hierarchy in typography may be developed through size, weight, color, style or placement of text components. Bigger or bolder
		text is inherently more interesting to read, whereas color differences or certain styles also provide a way to focus on 
		particular content. Placing key text appropriately at the top or center helps guide the viewer's focus effectively.<a href="https://spotify.design/">A Good Example of Design Hierarchy</a></li>

	<h2>Part 3/3</h2>
	<h3>Problem:</h3>
    <p>In a contemporary world where memes and emojis rule the digital conversation, new digital artists may find few 
		platforms to promote and share their work. Most sticker platforms focus on big-name creators, leaving smaller artists 
		without an easy way to reach audiences or build a following.</p>
	<h3>Audience:</h3>
	<p> It targets those who text every day and want fun, creative ways to express themselves beyond emojis. It also caters to young
		digital artists seeking a platform to share their work, gain followers, and connect with fans.</p>
	<h3>Competition:</h3>
	<p>Sticker packs on apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and LINE already give users plenty of options, but they mostly feature 
		pre-made or brand-driven sets. Unlike those, this site focuses on giving independent artists a spotlight.</p>
	<h3>Key Messages:</h3>
	<p>This site is a creative hub where digital stickers become a new way to communicate. It empowers artists to share their work,
		helps users find unique styles that match their personality, and turns everyday texting into something more expressive.</p>
	<h3>Call To Action:</h3>
	<p>Somthing like: Join the site to download free stickers, follow your favorite artists, and share their work with friends. Artists can upload
		their own packs and grow a community around their designs.</p>
	<h3>How to Measure Success:</h3>
	<p>Success can be measured by the number of active users downloading stickers, the growth of artist sign-ups, and how often people
	return to the site.</p>
