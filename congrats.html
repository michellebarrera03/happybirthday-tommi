  <h1>Happy Birthday Tommi &lt;3</h1>
  <p><strong>HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOMMI !!!!!</strong> Today a very special boy was born.
   A boy that is kind, sweet, and just. I am very happy to be a part of your life again, and if you continue to let me, I promise to do my best at keeping you happy.. although I think I might need you more than you'll need me :) 
    But I really want you to know that I've grown to really like you these past
    months. Thank you for letting me be a part of your life now. I enjoy talking
    to you and getting to learn more about you. I hope one day we can celebrate
    your birthday together in person. &lt;3
  </p>

      const message = `Before you download the PDF, please make sure you have some cardstock or thick paper on hand. I made it so you can print both paper double sided and it should align perfectly.. i staye dup all night figuring that out. ignore the awkward sqaure lol.. I made you a small prayer card since you mentioned you’re Catholic.

I actually have all my sacraments except one—I’m hoping to receive my last one with you by my side. I also want to wish you luck and protection from God.

I know it might sound a little crazy coming from me, someone who isn’t super religious, but it doesn’t hurt to believe, right? And if there really is an afterlife, I’d like to meet you in every single one.

If this feels too strong or too much, please let me know—no hard feelings! ( >_< )b`;
